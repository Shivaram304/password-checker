# 🔐 Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation

## 📌 Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and evaluate its effectiveness using online password strength checkers.

## ✅ Steps Followed

1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity:
   - Simple: `shiva123`
   - Medium: `Shiva@123`
   - Strong: `Sh!v@_20#25_SeCuRe`

2. Used the following online tools to check strength:
   -BITWarden (https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/).
   - [Security.org Password Strength Test](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)

3. Recorded the results for each password:
   | Password              | Strength | Estimated Crack Time             |
   |-----------------------|----------|----------------------------------|
   | `shiva123`            | Weak     | Instant                          |
   | `Shiva@123`           | Good     | Few hours                        |
   | `Sh!v@_20#25_SeCuRe`  | Strong   | Trillions of years (very strong) |
